title: About me 
---

I got my bachelor degree in Automation at Shandong University in China. I did a lot of work in embedded systems, STM32 and robotics during these days. 

Now I'm more inspired by computer science and I'm a MSCS student at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey in USA. 

I'm interested in artificial intelligence, computer vision and quantitative Forex trading. And a PhD degree in computer science is my first priority.
